### HTML scraping

Does including header content improve predictions? Answer the question and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.

Disregarding header content, the predictions had an accuracy rate of 70.79%, while including header content resulted in an accuracy rate of 71.50%. This improvement in prediction accuracy is relatively predictable given that headers provide a preview of the text that follows, so it may give a hint as to whether or not that text may contain fraud. However, we must also note that this improvement is quite small, which again makes sense due to the fact that the amount of text contained in a header is usually minimal. Thus it does seem that including header content improves the predictions. 

### Bigrams

Do bigrams capture additional information relevant to the classification of interest? Answer the question, **briefly** describe what analysis you conducted to arrive at your answer, and provide quantitative evidence supporting your answer.



### Neural net

Summarize the neural network model you trained by describing:

-   architecture

-   optimization and loss

-   training epochs

-   predictive accuracy
